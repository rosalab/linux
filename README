This branch contains a way to skip the kernel function execution in our case that is ip6_dst_gc
to trigger this function I made some changes to the kernel which is not needed incase we are live patching

The steps to run the code:
goto samples/bpf
make -j `nproc`
then run the bpf program inside the qemu 
./sid_klp_fib6_run_gc &
./trigger_bpf (this will trigger the bpf program)

this will not print the print statement in the kernel function as we are using ret value of fmod_ret as 1
you can change it to return 1 then follow the similar steps
this time it will execute the function

PS. you may need to enable dwares4 and dynamic_ftrace if they are not enabled in the config
